                            <p>As part of the website project, I also created custom icons and helped to prototype a
                                logo for the YouTuber's brand. This involved understanding the vision and style of the
                                brand, as well as iterating through several design concepts until the final product was
                                achieved. I worked closely with the YouTuber throughout the development process to
                                ensure that every aspect of the website, including the design elements, reflected their
                                unique personality and vision.</p>
                            <p>During the development of this project, I worked closely with the YouTuber to ensure that
                                the website met all of his needs and requirements. To achieve this, I developed a custom
                                WordPress theme from the ground up which included custom Gutenberg blocks for added
                                functionality and flexibility.</p>
                            <p>The process of building the custom WordPress theme involved several stages including
                                wireframing, prototyping, and iterative development. I implemented a clean and modern
                                design that allowed for easy navigation and quick access to the YouTuber's content.</p>
                            <p>Additionally, I continue to support the YouTuber by providing ongoing maintenance and
                                updates to the website as new content is added. This includes optimizing the website's
                                performance and ensuring that it remains secure and up-to-date with the latest web
                                technologies. My dedication to providing reliable and efficient support has helped the
                                YouTuber to focus on creating high-quality content without worrying about technical
                                issues or website maintenance.</p>

                                This project involved the development of AI Drones, where I applied reinforcement
                                learning to guide a drone to a specific target. This required research to gain the
                                knowledge of machine learning and deep understanding of the drone's environment, as well
                                as expertise in programming in C#.

                            <p>To support this project, I developed a custom matrix library from scratch, which enabled
                                me to perform a range of calculations required for the AI system. Despite the
                                significant progress made, further development is needed to optimize the system's
                                performance and enhance its capabilities.</p>
                            <p>Through my work on the AI Drones project, I was able to demonstrate my aptitude for
                                applying programming and mathematical concepts to tackle complex problems. Although I
                                did not have much prior knowledge at the beginning of the project, I was determined to
                                learn and apply new skills to develop innovative solutions.</p>
                            <p>The project serves as a testament to my passion for AI and my commitment to developing
                                cutting-edge technologies. As I continue to refine my skills and expand my knowledge, I
                                look forward to pursuing even more ambitious projects that push the boundaries of what
                                is possible in the field of AI.</p>

                                unmet need. Through close collaboration with the end user, I worked tirelessly to ensure
                                that every aspect of the software was tailored to their exact specifications. The result

                                built an installer for the software that streamlined the deployment process and made it
                                easy for end users to access the tool. However, sharing the save file proved to be the
                                most challenging aspect of the project. Nevertheless, I successfully overcame this
                                obstacle by implementing a local mySQL database and leveraging Google Drive's
                                capabilities for easy sharing.

                                I embarked on developing a game using Unity, leveraging my prior experience with this
                                game engine. During the planning phase, I set specific design goals, including a
                                complete separation of data and game logic from Unity. By utilizing Unity solely as a
                                rendering front-end, the core game mechanics could run independently of Unity's
                                functions, enabling me to build a server-client architecture from scratch. This approach
                                ensures that any dedicated server application created in the future will remain
                                independent of Unity. Additionally, the game was designed with support for mods in mind,
                                and I made sure that entity/object functionality and definitions could be loaded from
                                external files to facilitate this feature.

                                process, I am researching and defining the game's features and functionality more
                                precisely to ensure that the goals are well-defined from the outset.

                                One of the key features I am eager to implement is an Entity Component System (ECS) for
                                the game's core. This approach provides a clean and well-organized code structure, along

                                performance, the map was partitioned into chunks that could be dynamically loaded and
                                unloaded. Additionally, I endeavored to integrate multiplayer functionality, which
                                presented its own set of challenges. Despite my best efforts, I soon recognized that the
                                scope of the project was beyond the capacity of a sole developer. Consequently, I made

                                with them. After that, the server would back up the update and apply it before
                                restarting. At the same time, documentation would be updated to reflect the changes.
